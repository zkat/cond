    if (availableFlavors.indexOf(flavor) !== -1) {
        return flavor + " ice cream ゲットー!";
    } else {
        // Just like throw new Error("something"), but we provide a way
        // the user can recover from it.
        return cond.error("Sorry, that flavor is not available", [
            "different-flavor", "Try a different flavor", getIceCream
        ], [
            "add-flavor", "Add this flavor to available ones and retry", function() {
                availableFlavors.push(flavor);
                return getIceCream(flavor);
            }
        ]);

console.log(getIceCream("coffee"));
console.log("I really like this flavor!");

// In the console, do:

// > showRecoveries();
// > recover(0, "chocolate");

```

# Introduction

`cond` is a JavaScript implementation of
[Common Lisp's condition system](http://gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html),
a system for handling errors and other conditions of interest that handles
signals at the call site, before the stack is unwound -- allowing you to repair
or alter what happens at the callsite, and continuing executing as if nothing
had been signaled/thrown.
